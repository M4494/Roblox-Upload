# Intro
Hi :3

My name is Aimee. I'm an aspiring Python and LuaU developer. 
Please don't ask me why I made this bot. I just wanted to make a bot that I could use to make games.

Note: Copyrighted content is not allowed on this bot. If you're uploading content that you do not own, the content will be deleted nearly immediately. UPLOAD YOUR OWN GAMES!!

Please follow Roblox TOS when using this. I am not responsibile for any misuse of this bot.

Thanks :^)

You are allowed to use this bot for industrial/commercial purposes, but you must be able to provide a link to the source code.

Feel free to contact me at million@aimeee.xyz or Million1156#0001

# How to use
If you haven't already, download Python 3.10 [here](https://python.org/downloads).
After you've installed, go to the directory where these files are, and type ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Then, replace the bot token [(you can see how here)](https://uploadi.ng/H5ddTK9x) at the bottom of `main.py`

Finally, run ```python3 main.py``` or ```python main.py``` .

# Pull Requests
If you find any bugs, and know how to fix them, please make a pull request. I'd greatly appreciate it. Same for optimizations (ie: automatic generation of captcha tokens). I'll view them every now and then and try to implement as much changes as I can.
